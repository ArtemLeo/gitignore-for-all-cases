## A collection of `.gitignore` templates üñê 

This is GitHub‚Äôs collection of [`.gitignore`][man] file templates.
We can use this list to populate the `.gitignore` template choosers available
in the GitHub.com interface when creating new repositories and files.

For more information about how `.gitignore` files work, and how to use them,
the following resources are a great place to start:

- The [Ignoring Files chapter][chapter] of the [Pro Git][progit] book.
- The [Ignoring Files article][help] on the GitHub Help site.
- The [gitignore(5)][man] manual page.

## Folder structure

- The root folder contains templates in common use, to help people get started
  with popular programming languages and technologies. These define a meaningful
  set of rules to help get started, and ensure you are not committing
  unimportant files into your repository.
- [`Global`](./global) contains templates for various editors, tools and
  operating systems that can be used in different situations. It is recommended
  that you either [add these to your global template](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files#configuring-ignored-files-for-all-repositories-on-your-computer)
  or merge these rules into your project-specific templates if you want to use
  them permanently.
- [`community`](./community) contains specialized templates for other popular
  languages, tools and project, which don't currently belong in the mainstream
  templates. These should be added to your project-specific templates when you
  decide to adopt the framework or tool.

## What makes a good template?

A template should contain a set of rules to help Git repositories work with a
specific programming language, framework, tool or environment.

If it's not possible to curate a small set of useful rules for this situation,
then the template is not a good fit for this collection.

If a template is mostly a list of files installed by a particular version of
some software (e.g. a PHP framework), it could live under the `community`
directory. See [versioned templates](#versioned-templates) for more details.
